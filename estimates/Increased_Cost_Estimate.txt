If the budget increases I will add more database nodes and change their specs a little bit
in order to handle more requests from the application servers. 

I also added more EC2 instances for both web servers and application servers and increased their memory and vCPUS.

I have added some GPU optimized instances to the infrastructure that we could use for image and video processing,
since the infrastructure we are building is for a social media app.

The information provided its hard to know where to optimize. The requirements are not very precise.
